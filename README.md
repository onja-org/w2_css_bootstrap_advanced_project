# TechFlow Landing Page - Advanced Bootstrap Lab

## What You'll Build

By the end of this lab, you'll have created a fully responsive startup landing page featuring:
- Professional navigation with mobile toggle
- Eye-catching hero section with call-to-action
- Feature showcase with cards and icons
- Team member profiles
- Pricing table
- Responsive footer

## Prerequisites

- Basic HTML structure knowledge
- Understanding of CSS concepts
- Familiarity with Bootstrap grid basics
- Knowledge of Bootstrap components

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Build complex layouts using Bootstrap's grid system
- Create responsive designs that work on all devices
- Implement Bootstrap components effectively
- Use utility classes for spacing and alignment
- Structure a professional website without custom CSS

Don't worry if you don't complete the whole project in the allotted time or if you need to reference the solution. This lab has a lot of content, and it takes time to memorize Bootstrap classes and structures.

If you need more guidance or find yourself hopelessly lost, check the `README_EASIER.md` file, which contains a walkthrough for portions you are stuck on. The goal is to learn and practice Bootstrap skills -- you don't have to be perfect. You can always come back to finish later if you want to figure it all out yourself!

**Typography:**
- Use Bootstrap's default font stack
- Optional: Add Google Fonts for headings

## Getting Started

1. First, install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. You can run the automated tests to check your progress:
```bash
npm test
```

3. Or start a local development server:
```bash
npm run serve
```

For detailed implementation instructions, see [lab/README.md](lab/README.md).
